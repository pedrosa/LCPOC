# LCPOC

LCPOC is a POC that explain the life cycle of dependencies in a software project.

On this project exists libraries, modules, or packages that are required for a software project to function correctly. These dependencies can be of two types: compile-time dependencies and run-time dependencies.
The dependency lifecycle is an essential part of software project management. It helps ensure that the project is developed efficiently and that dependencies are properly managed. It is important to remember that dependencies must be updated regularly to ensure that the software is always working correctly.
